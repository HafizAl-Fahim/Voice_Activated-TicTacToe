**About It:**
An inclusive and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and Tkinter that allows users to play using voice commands, mouse clicks, or even claps to restart the game. Designed for both able-bodied and visually impaired players, this project combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, and sound-based gesture detection to ensure an accessible and fun experience for all.
